# Presentation:

-  find a better picture for pseudo agile Scrum
-  no transition for the "Design Decision" slide, change to summary
-  why do traditional architecture approaches often fail
   - architect not part of the team
   - ivory tower architecture
   - making decisions too early
   - transition: how can we plan for change we don't know about
     - disclaimer: for small-medium size projects
     - gather a list of requirements
     - ask the PO for priorities
     - gather a set of reqs which make up a minimum viable product
       - focus on nouns and verbs
       - whiteboard
       - CRC cards
     - find the simplest architecture which gets the job done
       - this can be a standard CMS
       - or MVC or whatever
       - don't overthink/overdesign at this stage
       - consider building a prototype
       - are there any comparable decisions
     - now consider other requirements, how flexible is the architecture
       - mark things as you move them around
       - which parts change more frequently
     - bonus: come up with other requirements which were not specified
       - do the requirements break your design
       -  or are they hard to fit in?
       - if so and if you consider this crucial make sure to let your PO know
       - but don't overdesign
     - important:
       - time to market
       - fail fast
       - **communcation!!!**
       - everyone should be on-board or understand
       - every design has trade-offs
       - don't worry about race-conditions just yet :) (in most cases)
   - rinse and repeat: sprint -1 or 0 in the beginning, during/after sprint planning and retrospectives
   - summary: we can (and have to) all be part of this
     - but: disclaimer
     - and learn your tools
     - if all you have in your toolbelt is a hammer, every problem is going to look like a nail to you 
-  move abstraction slide forward
-  maybe remove continuous integration slide?
-  move Sven's slides to the back, but talk about it and say we're about to open-source it
-  more concrete information on agile documentation
   -  generate as much as possible
   -  single source of truth
   -  BDD: requirements specification as documentation AND verification
   -  architecture specification as verification OR at-least capture current architecture
   -  versioned: Word < Wiki/Confluence < Versioned

-  transition to dePHPend
-  Idea:
   -  describe your architecture in PlantUML syntax
   -  match your namespaces to architectural components
   -  generate dePHPend constraints from PlantUML
   -  AND use the diagrams to document your architecture
   -  no more lying documentation
   -  less work, safer architecture 
   -  no more "<?php echo UserModel::getUser()->getUsername();"
